      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This policy applies to information we collect or use on sites and
        applications owned or controlled by Crewboard.
        <br /> <br /> Crewboard is not responsible for the privacy policies or
        practices of ad networks and other websites, third parties with whom we
        work to provide you personalized services, or those who access your
        information on our site or application.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Crewboard is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old
        and in no way is intended for users beyond age of 18.
      </h3>
      <h4>Information we collect:</h4>
      We collect information about you when you use our site and application. We
      collect information directly from you such as your contact information,
      CV, and profile information. We receive and store this information when
      you enter it on our website, send it to us, or provide it to us in any
      other way. <br /> <br /> We also collect information about you
      automatically. We automatically collect information about how you use our
      sites and mobile applications, the areas of our site that you visit, as
      well as information about your computer or mobile device including your IP
      address, device ID, physical location, browser and operating system type,
      and referring URLs. This information is necessary for providing
      personalized and location-based content as well as for analyzing web
      traffic, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our
      services. We may combine this information with information in your account
      to help prevent fraud. <br /> <br /> We may receive a confirmation when
      you open an email from Crewboard if your computer supports this type of
      program. <br /> <br /> We also collect information you post on another
      user’s profile or comment on another user’s post (this is mostly related
      to Employers).{' '}
      <h4>How does Crewboard use and share your personal data:</h4> We will only
      share personal data when we have the necessary right to do so. For
      jobseekers, most typically this refers to your CV profile which contains
      information you have provided to Crewboard including your contact
      information, work history, personal information, certificates, skills or
      other employment data related to yourself. Your CV profile may be shared
      with registered employers on Crewboard. This may occur when an employer
      finds your CV profile while searching our candidate database. Similarly,
      if you apply for a job posting listed by one of our registered employers
      or send your cv, your personal information may be shared.
      <br /> <br /> We attempt to limit access to your CV and profile database
      to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain
      access to this database. We cannot control the use made of CVs by third
      parties who access the database. Once your CV has been disclosed,
      Crewboard is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed
      it. Anyone who viewed your CV or profile may have kept a copy of it in
      their own files or databases. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive
      information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want
      made public, in your CV or profile. If your CV or profile does contain
      sensitive information, then you agree that it is at your own risk.
      <br /> <br /> We also share aggregated information (including location
      data) about Crewboard site visitors and application users with third
      parties to serve advertisements to you online. We may also aggregate data
      regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other
      information relevant to the job search. This aggregated data does not
      identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or
      fellow job seekers.
      <br /> <br /> If as a candidate you have opted-in to receiving promotional
      materials from third parties, information you have made available to us
      may be made available to these third parties who provide goods or services
      that we believe may be of interest to you. For employers, any information
      you choose to share on your company that is displayed on your job postings
      is shared with prospective candidates. Personal data from employers beyond
      what is seen on job postings is not shared, and only used internally.{' '}
      <br /> <br />{' '}
      <strong>How we use non-personally identifiable information:</strong> We
      use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build
      higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of
      the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and users, and
      by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the
      Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data to
      advertisers, users, and other current and potential business partners. We
      may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the
      number of people who have viewed and/or clicked through links to their
      sites. If we create a co-branded site with another company, information
      will be retained by both companies and subject to the privacy policies of
      both companies which will be published on the co-branded sites.{' '}
      <h4>For personal data that we have about you, you can:</h4>
      <strong>Delete Data:</strong> You can delete information about yourself
      that you have entered or ask us to erase or delete your personal data
      (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). Normally
      your personal data and account will be completely removed from Creboard
      within 72 hours.
      <br /> <br /> We retain your personal data even after you have closed your
      account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations
      (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements,
      resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our
      User Agreement. We will retain de-personalized information after your
      account has been closed.
      <br /> <br /> Information you have shared with others (e.g., through
      InMail, by sending your cv or applying for jobs) will remain visible after
      you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile,
      and we do not control data that other Users copied out of our Services.
      Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed
      accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may
      continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine
      results) until they refresh their cache.
      <br /> <br /> <strong>Change or Correct Data:</strong> You can edit some
      of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change,
      update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.{' '}
      <br /> <br />
      <strong>Hide your account and data:</strong> You can make your personal
      data hidden from employment companies who use our website and prevent any
      access to your cv. <br /> <br />{' '}
      <strong>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data:</strong>
      You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of
      personal data you provided in machine readable form.
      <br /> <br /> You should sign in to your account or use contact form to
      contact web-site administrator for the purposes listed above.{' '}
      <h4>Data Retention:</h4> We will retain your information for as long as
      your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. If you wish
      to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information
      to provide you Services, contact us by contact form. <h4>Security:</h4>{' '}
      You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret. We take
      appropriate measures to secure your personal information from accidental
      loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However
      we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to
      defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper
      purposes. <br /> <br /> Creboard doesn’t have access to your passwords and
      they are stored in encrypted form. <h4>Tracking Technologies:</h4>
      Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and
      our partners, analytics, and service providers. These technologies are
      used generally for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking
      users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information
      about our user base as a whole. <h4>Pixels:</h4> We use pixels, or
      transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These files
      enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web
      browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring
      users to our Site. The information that we collect does not contain your
      name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information go

      <h4>Facebook Pixel:</h4> We use Facebook Pixel on Crewboard. Facebook
      Pixel is a tracking code which allows us to manage and analyze success of
      advertising campaigns we run on Facebook as well as to upgrade efficiency
      of those ads. This is done by collecting information about the kind of
      device you use to access Crewboard and actions you normally take on the
      website. Therefore, Facebook Pixel is normally used to create custom
      audiences interested in a particular product or retargeting
      advertisements. <br /> <br /> Facebook, in turn, collects data from the
      Facebook Pixel placed on Crewboard to improve advertisement and
      measurement services provided by Facebook and the associated companies. If
      you’d like to find out more about how Facebook handles information they
      aggregate, the details are available in their Privacy Policy:{' '}

      <h4>Cookies:</h4> <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4> A cookie is a text file
      stored on your computer. Cookies store bits of information that we use to
      help make our site work. They can’t run any code and don’t contain
      viruses. No one can read our cookies except us. <br /> <br /> We may use
      browser cookies to personalize a user’s pages at our Crewboard, to
      remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for
      fraud prevention, or to track visits to our Creboard. If a user does not
      want us or our partners to deploy browser cookies in the user’s browser
      when the user visits the Crewboard, the user may set the browser to reject
      cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in
      the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user’s ability to use
      some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Crewboard.{' '}
      <br /> <br /> The ads appearing on the Creboard may be delivered to
      visitors by third parties, such as Google. The third party advertising
      technology that we use on the Creboard uses information derived from a
      user’s visits to the Creboard to target advertising within the Creboard.
      In addition, our advertisers may use other third party advertising
      technology to target advertising on the Creboard. In the course of serving
      advertisements to the Creboard, our partners may place or recognize a
      unique cookie on a user’s browser. Information about users’ visits to the
      Creboard, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not
      users’ names, addresses, or other personal information), are used to serve
      ads to visitors. The use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to
      users based on such user’s visit to the Crewboard and other Creboard on
      the Internet. As with other cookies, and consistent with our policy on
      cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the
      user’s drive or memory. For more information about Google, Google’s use of
